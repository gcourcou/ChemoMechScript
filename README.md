# ChemoMechScript

This repository contains the necessarily materials to reproduce the results in "Avalanches During Epithelial Tissue Growth; Uniform Growth and a Drosophila Eye Disc Model" by Courcoubetis et. al. 

To run this file please install the tyssue package dependencies: conda install --only-deps -c conda-forge tyssue

Then, clone the github repository  https://github.com/gcourcou/tyssue.

While in the master branch, install the tyssue package in the cloned directory: python setup.py install

Note the path of the installation and add it to the sys.argv path in the scripts to run our custom tyssue. 

Note : In future releases of tyssue, our code will be merged so that one can simply install tyssue and proceed.
